    "the name description": "Bayt in Arabic means home. Salwa means having pleasure, fun, and chill. The origins come from the owner of the property Salwa who has the personality as the cabin itself. Bayt Salwa is where any person will find peace and happiness. The sound of the water smashing the rocks in a quite night is so calm and during some nights, the howl of the wind is loud and loud. Other nights, it's the howl of the small wolves far far away. I don't want to lie, it's a bit scary but make sure that you are safe.",
    "the built description": "It was an empty lot for many years because cars couldn't get in and it would take a long time to walk to the place. After the expension of the village and when some other houses started to be built, Bayt Salwa was born. The cabin itself is a pre-fabricated container embedded in the mountain and then additional rooms where added. The architect who had the vision about the whole process was Jana; Salwa's daughter. Jana is an Interior Architect who has great visions and a huge passion for natural architecture. She's also an artist. The cabin itself is a getaway to family as well where they chill some weekends far from cars, pollution, and the loud cities.",

The latter extends to around 50 meters inwards; both caves add a beautiful natural scenery to the landscape. An old mosque stands in the town and dates back to 1850 CE.",
